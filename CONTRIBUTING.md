## 🏷️ Labels and Organization

### Using Labels
We use labels to organize and prioritize issues. You don't need to add labels yourself - maintainers will apply appropriate labels during triage.

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Triage** - New issues are reviewed and labeled
2. **Planning** - Accepted issues are added to project boards
3. **Development** - Issues move to "in progress" when work begins
4. **Review** - Completed work is reviewed and tested
5. **Closed** - Issues are closed when resolved or declined

## 💬 Communication Guidelines

### Be Respectful
- Treat all community members with respect
- Use constructive language when providing feedback
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started

### Be Clear and Concise
- Use clear, descriptive titles and descriptions
- Provide context for your suggestions or reports
- Ask questions if something is unclear
- Update issues with new information as needed

### Stay On Topic
- Keep discussions relevant to the issue at hand
- Use GitHub Discussions for general conversation
- Create new issues for separate problems
- Reference related issues when appropriate

## 🔒 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead:

1. Email details to [me@mrakaki.com](mailto:me@mrakaki.com)
2. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
3. Provide any relevant technical details
4. Wait for confirmation before disclosing publicly

We take security seriously and will respond promptly to legitimate reports.

## 📊 Project Management

### Project Boards
We use GitHub Projects to track development progress:
- Issues move through columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
- Milestones group related issues for releases
- Labels indicate priority and type

### Release Process
- Features and fixes are grouped into releases
- Release notes highlight changes and improvements
- Breaking changes are clearly documented
- Migration guides are provided when needed
